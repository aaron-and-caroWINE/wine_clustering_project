# Wine Project: Clustering

## Description
- This project will use clustering methods in combination with supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the quiality of wine using a dataset acquired from data.world. It will go through the data science pipeline and create a model that accurately predicts the quality of wine.

## Goals
- Predict the quality of wine using features in the dataset
  - Construct a ML model that accurately predicts wine quality
  - Deliver a technical report that a data scientist can read through and understand 

## Initial Questions
TBD

## Plan
- Acquire data from data.world
- Prepare data
  - Remove unnecessary features
  - Identify and replace missing values
  - Alter innapropriate data types
- Explore the data to find drivers and answer intital questions
- Apply clustering algorithms to find patterns
- Create a model to predict values
  - Use features identified in explore to build predictive models
  - Evaluate models on train and validate data
  - Select the best model based on drivers identified in exploration
  - Evaluate the best model on test data
- Conclude with recommendations and next steps
